# Computer Graphics Project - Erasmus Exchange, Pisa

This project was developed as part of the *Computer Graphics* course at the University of Pisa under Professor Fabio Ganovelli. It demonstrates the step-by-step creation of a 3D car model, animated movement through a map, and realistic lighting and shadow effects, using the EnvyMyCar (NVMC) framework with WebGL.

## Features

- **3D Car Modeling and Animation**: Built and animated a 3D car model with smooth movements and rotations, integrated with a race-track environment.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Implemented a sun and other light sources for real-time lighting changes, casting shadows across the map and car.
- **Multiple Camera Views**:
  - **Chase View**: A rear-follow camera that moves behind the car.
  - **Flying View**: A high aerial perspective controlled by the user giving a complete view of the car and map.
  - **Follow-from-Up View**: A top-down view that follows the car from above, suitable for navigating the map.

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: For rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **JavaScript & HTML**: Core scripting for animations, interactions, and UI.
- **NVMC Framework**: Provided by the course for a structured approach to interactive graphics applications.
